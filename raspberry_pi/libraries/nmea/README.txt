Project: NMEA Library

Description:
This Eclipse project (static C library) is based off source code found from 
the NMEA Library project on sourceforge.  Unfortunately, it didn't include 
the necessary files to compile on Linux so I made an Eclipse project to help
facilitate that process.

See the ./include/nmea path for necessary header information.  See the original
project website for sample code.
